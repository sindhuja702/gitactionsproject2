          A day,
            That I'm waiting for from years.
            He handed me flowers,a gift from his heartðŸ’–,
            And within their petals,a love did impart.
            For in that instant ,tears welled in my eyes.
            Those flowers are symbol of his affection so pureðŸ’–..
            A language of love that words can't procure.
            I found a treasure in that choclate..
            A heart beyond any measureðŸ’–..
            Cherishing those tears till,
            For they speak volumes untold..
            Of a love story written in petals of gold..
            Forever etched in my heart's sweet designðŸ’– .
            Tears of joy,like dew drops adorned my eyes..
            For his tender gesture took me by surpriseðŸ’–..
